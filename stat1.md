## Boxing Performance Analysis

### 1. Number of Punches Thrown

To identify punches, we look for a significant and rapid increase in both `Hand-to-Shoulder` (LH–LS or RH–RS) and `Hand-to-Face` (LH–Face or RH–Face) distances, followed by a clear retraction back to a guard position.

**Left Hand Punches (Jabs): 4**
1.  **Punch 1 (Frames 20-25):** LH–LS increases from ~51 to 100.4; LH–Face increases from ~82 to 140.5. (Peak at Frame 25)
2.  **Punch 2 (Frames 74-86):** LH–LS increases from ~3.6 to 147.1; LH–Face increases from ~49 to 161.6. (Peak at Frame 86)
3.  **Punch 3 (Frames 143-150):** LH–LS increases from ~29.6 to 95.1; LH–Face increases from ~57.2 to 139.1. (Peak at Frame 150)
4.  **Punch 4 (Frames 174-178):** LH–LS increases from ~53.8 to 109.2; LH–Face increases from ~87.9 to 154.3. (Peak at Frame 178)

**Right Hand Punches (Crosses): 5**
1.  **Punch 1 (Frames 39-47):** RH–RS increases from ~75.9 to 166.2; RH–Face increases from ~37.2 to 98.8. (Peak at Frame 47)
2.  **Punch 2 (Frames 106-117):** RH–RS increases from ~42.3 to 174.9; RH–Face increases from ~47.0 to 106.7. (Peak at Frame 117)
3.  **Punch 3 (Frames 127-136):** RH–RS increases from ~50.0 to 154.3; RH–Face increases from ~48.8 to 154.3. (Peak at Frame 136)
4.  **Punch 4 (Frames 156-168):** RH–RS increases from ~55.0 to 161.0; RH–Face increases from ~42.2 to 100.4. (Peak at Frame 168)
5.  **Punch 5 (Frames 184-197):** RH–RS increases from ~55.6 to 179.0; RH–Face increases from ~45.2 to 112.7. (Peak at Frame 197 - still retracting at end of data)

### 2. Jab or Hook Classification

Classification is based on the ratio of `Hand-to-Shoulder` distance to `Hand-to-Face` distance at peak extension:
*   **Jab/Cross (Straight Punch):** `Hand-to-Shoulder` distance is typically significantly *greater* than `Hand-to-Face` distance, as the hand extends past the face. Ratio (LS/Face or RS/Face) > 1.
*   **Hook (Curved Punch):** `Hand-to-Face` distance might be relatively smaller or similar to `Hand-to-Shoulder` distance, as the hand travels in an arc and doesn't necessarily extend far "past" the face. Ratio (LS/Face or RS/Face) <= 1, especially if the hand doesn't extend far from the face.

**Left Hand Punches (Jabs):**
All 4 left hand punches consistently show a peak `LH–LS / LH–Face` ratio of less than 1 (0.71, 0.91, 0.68, 0.70). This is unusual for a classical straight jab where the hand extends clearly past the face. However, given they are the lead hand and show significant forward extension (large absolute values for both metrics), they are most likely **Jabs**. The peculiar ratio may indicate specific body mechanics (e.g., head moving forward with the punch), or a slight upward or lateral trajectory (which can be present in a jab), or an interpretation artifact of the keypoint data.

**Right Hand Punches (Crosses):**
Most right hand punches show a `RH–RS / RH–Face` ratio significantly greater than 1 (1.68, 1.63, 1.60, 1.58). This is characteristic of a **Cross** (a straight power punch from the rear hand).
One instance (Punch 3, Frame 136) shows a ratio of exactly 1.0 (154.3 / 154.3). While this is ambiguous for a straight cross, given the consistency of other right-hand punches, it's likely still a **Cross** where the body/head significantly rotated or moved forward, causing the hand-to-face distance to be unexpectedly high at peak. Without more data (e.g., body angle), it's difficult to definitively classify it as a hook.

**Conclusion on Punch Types:**
*   **Left Hand:** 4 Jabs
*   **Right Hand:** 5 Crosses

### 3. Stance or Balance Issues

The data provided for `Knees` and `Toes` is consistently "None" across all frames. Therefore, it is **not possible to analyze stance or balance issues** from this dataset.

### 4. Coaching Tips on Improving Form

Based on the provided data, here are 2-3 coaching tips:

1.  **Refine Left Hand Guard and Hand Placement:** The `LH–Face` distance remains relatively high even when the left hand is seemingly in a guard position (e.g., at the beginning of punch cycles or after retraction). This suggests the left hand might not be consistently kept tight to the face for optimal protection. Additionally, the peculiar `LH–Face > LH–LS` ratio at peak extension for jabs could imply that the hand isn't fully extending straight *past* the face, or that the head is moving excessively into the punch.
    *   **Coaching Tip:** Focus on bringing the left hand back to a tight, protective guard position immediately after each punch. Practice extending the left jab with a focus on a straight, linear trajectory where the hand clearly extends *past* the face, driving from the shoulder and engaging the core.

2.  **Maximize Power Generation in Left Hand Punches:** The right hand punches (crosses) show excellent extension (high `RH–RS` values) and a favorable `RH–RS / RH–Face` ratio (greater than 1.5), indicating strong, straight power delivery. In contrast, while the left jabs are extended, their `LH–LS / LH–Face` ratio is unusual. This might suggest the athlete is not fully engaging their core and hip rotation for the left hand in the same way as for the right.
    *   **Coaching Tip:** Emphasize rotational power for left hand punches. Encourage the athlete to pivot the lead foot, rotate the hips and torso, and drive through the shoulder to achieve maximum reach, power, and a more biomechanically efficient straight jab, similar to the powerful crosses observed.

3.  **Maintain Consistent Stance and Movement (General):** While specific data is unavailable for knees and toes, consistent balance is fundamental in boxing. Even in shadowboxing, maintaining a strong, athletic stance ensures power generation, efficient movement, and quick recovery.
    *   **Coaching Tip:** Pay conscious attention to maintaining a balanced and athletic boxing stance throughout all movements and punch combinations. Ensure weight is distributed evenly or shifted intentionally to generate power, and that the base remains stable to allow for fluid transitions and quick defensive movements.
